# Flock

A toy model of a flock of birds / flies / fish (depending on the parameter settings) using Processing. (See Processing.org)

For the sake of speed, note all "birds" interact with each other, instead, they follow a small number of leaders, and sporadically (at random) change 
allegiance. Following is achieved by steering towards a leader, with a finite turning-circle.
